# Native Bindings

## Status

Pumas has a UniFFI adapter and generators for Python, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, and
C#. CI generates archives, and the repository includes a local C# compile/load
smoke. The project does not yet have a verified host/runtime support matrix, so
these bindings should be treated as experimental rather than generally
supported SDKs.

`pumas_rustler` is also experimental. Its current NIF surface consists mainly
of local conversions and does not expose the core Pumas library API.

## Boundary

```text
host application
  -> generated language binding
    -> pumas_uniffi native library
      -> pumas-uniffi adapter
        -> pumas-core
```

The adapter owns FFI-safe records, conversions, validation, runtime bridging,
and host-visible error projection. Generated sources and native libraries are a
single compatibility cohort and must come from the same build.

## Generate and Check

```bash
./scripts/generate-bindings.sh python
./scripts/generate-bindings.sh csharp
./scripts/check-uniffi-surface.sh
./scripts/check-uniffi-csharp-smoke.sh
```

Generated outputs belong under ignored build/output directories and must not be
hand-edited. Some generation paths install bindgen tools when absent; pin and
provision those tools explicitly before treating output as reproducible release
evidence.

The C# smoke compiles generated sources, loads the matching native library, and
calls the synchronous version function. It does not prove async APIs or domain
workflows.

## Local C#/Native Packaging

```bash
./scripts/package-uniffi-csharp-artifacts.sh
```

The script stages archives under `rust/target/bindings-package/artifacts/` and
copies this document into them. Inspect each generated `manifest.json` for the
native filename, platform, profile, and matching package identity.

At runtime, place the matching native library beside the host executable or on
the platform's native-library search path (`PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`). Never combine generated sources and a native library from
different commits, versions, targets, or profiles.

## Promotion Requirements

A host/language combination becomes supported only when CI or equivalent
release evidence exercises the exact packaged cohort through:

- native library loading;
- a synchronous call;
- an async call where exported;
- invalid-input and error projection; and
- the documented target/runtime versions.

The [current standards audit](audits/current-standards-2026-09-03/README.md)
tracks the remaining binding and packaging gaps.
